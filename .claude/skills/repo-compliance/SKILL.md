Orchestrates a full compliance audit and optional remediation run against any repository.

## Invocation

```
/repo-audit                          # interactive mode, current directory
/repo-audit /path/to/repo            # interactive mode, specified path
/repo-audit --scheduled              # report-only mode for cron trigger
```

## Mode Selection

- Default (no flag): interactive mode, see `workflows/interactive-mode.md`
- `--scheduled`: scheduled mode, see `workflows/scheduled-mode.md`

## Workflow

Follow the appropriate workflow file for the selected mode. Both modes share these steps:

1. Load `~/.claude/docs/standards-manifest.yaml`
2. Load target repo's `.claude/compliance-overrides.md` (if present)
3. Dispatch domain agents in parallel (see workflow file for agent list and prompts)
4. Merge findings, filter overrides, sort by severity
5. Run `compliance-retrospective` after all repos are processed

## Domain Agents

| Domain | Agent | Checks |
|--------|-------|--------|
| foundations | `repo-foundations-auditor` | FOUND-* |
| toolchain | `python-toolchain-auditor` | TOOL-* |
| pre_commit | `pre-commit-auditor` | PC-* |
| ci | `devops-deployment-agent` (CI audit mode) | CI-* |
| claude_docs | `claude-docs-auditor` | CLAUDE-* |
| general | `general-compliance-auditor` | unclassified |

## Coordinator Prompt Template

When dispatching each domain agent, include in the prompt:

```
Mode: <audit|remediation>
Target repo: <absolute path>
Manifest checks for this domain:
<paste the relevant check entries from standards-manifest.yaml>
Override entries (skip these check IDs):
<paste entries from compliance-overrides.md, or "none">
```
